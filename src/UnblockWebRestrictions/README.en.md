# Unblock webpage restrictions

> [GitHub](https://github.com/rxliuli/userjs/blob/master/src/UnblockWebRestrictions/), [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/zh-CN/scripts/391193)

## Introduction

The reason why this script is written is that the existing UserJS scripts are inconvenient to add/disable domain names, so that you can write one yourself, which is convenient for our generation.

## Features

Forced to allow selection/copy/paste
Disable the small tail when copying web pages
Allow quick enable/disable via menu (mainly improved)
Dynamic update support for domain name list (main improvement)

## Help

If you find that you don't have a supported domain name, you can click _Tampermonkey => Unblock Limit => Unblock_ to take effect, or, on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/rxliuli/userjs/issues), so that everyone can update the domain as a restriction.
